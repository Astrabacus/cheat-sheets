## google earthenterprise
- Earth Enterprise is the open source release of Google Earth Enterprise, a geospatial application which provides the ability to build and host custom 3D globes and 2D maps.
- https://github.com/google/earthenterprise
- Earth Enterprise does not provide a private version of Google imagery that's currently available in Google Maps or Earth.
- The application suite consists of three core components:
	- Fusion - imports and fuses imagery, vector and terrain source data in to a single flyable 3D globe or 2D map.
	- Server - Apache or Tornado-based server which hosts the private globes built by Fusion.
	- Client - the Google Earth Enterprise Client (EC) and Google Maps Javascript API V3 used to view 3D globes and 2D maps, respectively.
